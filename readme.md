# Usurper's Travels

Is a game I started working on around the same time I started developing Grometry Grash. Its a turn-based hack-and-slash rougelike RPG thats heavily inspired by games like Dark Souls and Path of Achra. I didn't realise how complex it would be to make and balance such a game, so some items are incredibly unbalanced - but isn't the point of a roguelike for you to be comically overpowered by the end?

## One more thing...
Press ESC when in a level to show controls - I appreciate the game may not be the most intuitive to understand and play.
