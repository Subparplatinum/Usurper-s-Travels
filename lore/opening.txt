The night was not always dark and full of terrors...

Across the void, a thousand star-gods cast their light into the Darkness, and kept it at bay.
That was, until the betrayal.

King Raah of Asterant, driven by the jealousy of their patron god Solei against their divine 
brethren, defied fate and struck down Khurgan, known as the Bloody Star. As their crimson 
remains breached the firmament, Darkness followed. 

Now, as Solei's gaze grows hotter during the day, and countless mortals struggle against the
ruin that Darkness brings at night, the Zodiacs of the Pale City have found a path towards
salvation. Heroes shall be found, given blessed star-golems as allies, and sent out on a quest.
Using Khurgan's divine essence to grant them strength through sacrifice, these Usurpers shall
grow in power until they can strike down Raah and take his throne. Only then, can Solei be
punished for their treachery.

So then, Usurper, are you ready to begin your travels?
